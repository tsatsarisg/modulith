NodeJS Microservice with ExpressJS and Typescript

This microservice is built using NodeJS and implements a REST API written with ExpressJS and Typescript. The architecture of this microservice follows Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles and the onion architecture pattern.

The DDD architecture focuses on creating software that is centered around the core business logic and domain, while keeping the infrastructure and technical concerns separate. This approach helps in maintaining a separation of concerns and promotes the creation of clean, maintainable code.

The onion architecture, on the other hand, is a software design pattern that organizes the codebase in concentric layers, where each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the application. The innermost layer contains the business logic, and each outer layer adds more technical details and infrastructure concerns.

Together, these two architectural patterns form a powerful combination that allows for the creation of robust and scalable microservices.
